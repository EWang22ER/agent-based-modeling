# About the Project 
Over the summer of 2024, Professor Weiqun Peng and myself, Eric Wang, collaborated in an attempt to employ agent-based modeling to study emergent behavior in embryonic development. After learning about agent-based modeling and choosing a programming language to conduct the project with, I practiced creating relatively simple agent-based models (ABMs) from online tutorials. 
The focus then turned towards replicating the results of and understanding the model used in the paper "A mathematical framework for understanding the spontaneous emergence of complexity applicable to growing multicellular systems." The authors of said paper simulate embryonic development in one dimension to investigate how positional information arises; positional information refers to how cells in an embryo develop unique functions by interpreting where they are positioned relative to other cells. 
After successfully replicating said results, I altered the existing models, extending them to two dimensions and adding components such as selective growth and death. The goal here was to work towards understanding and capturing the rules of synthetic embryonic development using ABMs. 
# Overview of Files 
The files included in the directory are of three types. They are either Jupyter notebooks containing the code created for agent-based modeling practice (those that begin with "Mesa"), Jupyter notebooks containing the code created for the replication of the results of the target paper (O1 and T1 models), or Jupyter notebooks containing the code for the extensions and alterations made to the target paper's models (2D, mutual repression, and selective growth and death models).
